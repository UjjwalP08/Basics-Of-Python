when we import our python file  to other python file
you should check first your all file is only in one folder
not other folders

never give your file name as per module name it is generate problem

In oops in python in always first find instance variable in child or parent class
and if he found it so print it but if he not found so he print class variable
of that class which is inherit and if he also not found in class variable so he
print class variable of "parent" class
